This is the initial alpha release of QuicRaft, a multi-group Raft consensus library for Go.

## [0.1.0-alpha] - 2026-03-10

### Added

- Multi-group Raft consensus with per-shard configuration and sharded ReadyMap (64 buckets) for O(1) dispatch
- Full Raft specification compliance: leader election, log replication, membership changes, snapshots, PreVote, CheckQuorum, leadership transfer
- Linearizable reads via ReadIndex and LeaseRead
- QUIC-only transport built on quic-go with mTLS and multiplexed streams
- QUIC 0-RTT reconnection support for reduced handshake latency
- Custom fixed-layout binary wire format with zero-copy semantics (no protobuf dependency)
- Algorithm-agile at-rest encryption (AES-128/192/256-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305, XChaCha20-Poly1305) with automatic hardware detection, barrier/seal/unseal pattern, and epoch-based key rotation
- HKDF-SHA256 derived data encryption keys with brute-force protection
- 16-shard write-ahead log (WAL) for parallel persistence with fdatasync durability and CRC32 checksums
- WAL compaction and crash recovery with log replay
- Engine worker pipeline: step, commit, and apply workers with snapshot pool
- Client session management for at-most-once proposal delivery and cross-replica deduplication
- Three state machine interfaces: StateMachine, ConcurrentStateMachine, and DiskStateMachine
- Optional NALookup interface for zero-allocation reads
- Optional Hasher interface for cross-replica consistency checks
- RSM adapter wrapping state machine interfaces with two-phase snapshot support
- Cluster discovery via static peer lists, UDP multicast with HMAC-SHA256 authentication, and DNS SRV records
- Automated bootstrap orchestration with quorum validation
- Global and per-shard rate limiting for proposal backpressure
- Lock-free hot paths using padded atomics to prevent false sharing
- 16-shard QUIC stream pool with dedicated heartbeat stream (stream 0)
- Pooled byte buffers on send and receive paths via sync.Pool
- Connection coalescing via singleflight.Group
- Prometheus metrics for proposals, commits, elections, snapshots, transport, and WAL operations
- Graceful ordered shutdown: step, commit, apply, snapshot with drain guarantee
- In-memory KV state machine for testing and examples
- Porcupine-based linearizability test suite
- 500+ unit tests with race detector coverage
